Typo correction: At 14 minutes 45 seconds, the last index on the bias vector is n, when it's supposed to in fact be a k.  Thanks for the sharp eyes that caught that!

For those who want to learn more, I highly recommend the book by Michael Nielsen introducing neural networks and deep learning: https://goo.gl/Zmczdy

There are two neat things about this book.  First, it's available for free, so consider joining me in making a donation Nielsen's way if you get something out of it.  And second, it's centered around walking through some code and data which you can download yourself, and which covers the same example that I introduce in this video.  Yay for active learning!

I also highly recommend Chris Olah's blog: http://colah.github.io/

For more videos, Welch Labs also has some great series on machine learning:

SUBSCRIBE OUR CHANNEL

It’s hard to believe how far we’ve come. We launched just a few years ago with our surveillance drones, and in this short amount of time, we’ve retooled cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, such as deep learning and convolution neural networks, into hardware systems that governments and peace-keeping agencies can use to keep their troops safe. No more sending our brave patriots home in coffins. Now the artificial intelligence does all of the work. Our autonomous weapons are small, fast, accurate, and unstoppable.
And they are just the beginning. Smart swarms. Adaptive adversarial learning. On-the-field robust target prioritization. AI-powered tactics and strategy a Go master would envy. This is the future of peacekeeping.

About the technology
Our Autonomous anti-Personnel Systems (APS) employ an array of cutting edge AI technology, including:

Obstacle avoidance: the neural network copied into every APS has been trained through the equivalent of millions of hours in varied simulated environments to avoid obstacles, even when they are in motion.
Stochastic movements: trained on thousands of movies of mosquitoes and other flying insects, our drones will defeat any attempt to anticipate their flight patterns.
Efficient munitions: using precise targeting, we are able to drive the size of a projectile and propellant to a bare minimum.
Facial recognition: it’s in your iPhone and it’s in APS, along with parallel networks to identify targets by gait, gender, uniform, even ethnicity.
Multiple self-location protocols: along with GPS, our APSs use a variety of proprietary technologies to locate themselves in space.
Incommunicado and EMP hardened: once an APS gets flying, there is no way to stop it electromagnetically by jamming, spoofing, zapping, or anything else.
Big data links: we’ve acquired and consolidated a host of data sets. Using our servers you can reliably tie individuals to their individual characteristics for later targeting. We’d tell you more, but as the joke goes, then we’d have to kill you. (And of course, since you’ve visited this site we know exactly who you are.) Again, just kidding!

The Stinger anti-Personnel System
The Stinger is our first mass-produced mini-weapon. It's fully autonomous with wide-field cameras, tactical sensors, facial recognition, processors that can react 100 times faster than a human, and its stochastic motion is an anti-sniper feature. Inside it are three grams of shaped explosives that offer just enough power to penetrate the skull and kill the target with surgical precision.

All About Teamwork
Vanguard Delivery and Breaching System
Each delivery system can carry 18 Stingers. The delivery system arrives at a building or some other enclosed space (car, train, plane, you name it), releases its cargo, attaches to the barrier, and blows a hole in the wall or window. The Stingers can then enter the building and find their targets. These systems are virtually unstoppable. Target terrorist cells, infiltrate enemy compounds -- the bad guys will not be able to defend against them.

Identify and Target Only the Bad Guys
The EyeFire Target Identification System
All of our systems can use facial recognition to identify a predetermined target, but what about threatening underground movements or secret terrorists cells? It's not like there are public hashtags that terrorists use to identify themselves. The EyeFire Target Identification System isn't just the little bot, but an entire big-data processing system that can scan billions of tweets, posts, pages, videos, and anything else you can find online to identify patterns indicative of terrorist activity. The system then crawls that data to identify IP addresses and GPS locations to identify the suspect posting the dangerous messages. It can also track down who the suspect is collaborating with. We'll help you weed out the bad guys.
SoftTouch Bot
A new form of regime change. The world is full of deadly leaders who are harming their citizens and threatening global security. Until recently, it's been hard to oust these bad actors: they're hard to get to and even if someone can get close enough for the kill, an obvious murder can lead to greater unrest. But these little bots are about the size of a bee, they can fly anywhere, get inside any building, hide inside any vent, and strike while the target sleeps. The question literally becomes: what's your poison? The bots can be filled with a lethal dose of the poison of your choice, and the mark left on the body will be barely noticeable, looking like nothing more than a bug bite.","['KILLER DRONE', 'INTELLIGENCE', 'DEFENCE', 'PRIVACY', 'SECURITY', 'Drone', 'Arm Industries', 'Intelligent Weapons', 'Spying', 'Terrorism', 'Drone Killer', 'Prepper', 'Survival', 'Technology', 'Privacy', 'Tesla', 'Ferrari', 'Lamborghini', 'MSC']",22

Samantha is one of the recent ""hyper realistic""  artificial intelligence female robot.

Samantha is a project centered on a robot that is capable of enjoying time together. Samantha is the name of the project and architecture. 
The name of the robot itself can be selected and introduced into the Samantha architecture.

As you interact with her, she gets to know you and synchronizes with you.

The doll is interactive, responding to voices as well as to touch.

She comes complete with sensors in her face, hands, and some more parts of her body and it is claimed she requires a more 
subtle approach when it comes to bedroom activities.

Sergi Santos, the designer of a love machine called Samantha, said the amorous android was so erotic that men were already developing real 
feelings for her.

In the BBC documentary Samantha's maker Sergi Santos said: ""They will fall in love with her. It's happening already.""

But the doll isn't all about having love, Samantha can also discuss philosophy, science and animals.

She's also got a great sense of humor with more than a thousand jokes in her repertoire.

Robots are more advanced than many of us may think. They are fully capable of having real world conversations, and have the mental and cognitive structures to eventually surpass humanity in 3-5 years according to Hanson Robotic chief scientist Ben Goertzel. 

Elon Musk with his Artificial Intelligence company OpenAI, which studies the potential dangers associated with A.I. has been adamantly warning humanity that Artificial Intelligence poses one of the biggest impending dangers humanity must confront in the coming years.

The Russians are also in the A.I. game, and have essentially built a Terminator like war robot termed Fedor. They have a robot that doesn't just accurately shoots targets, but also drives a car, which puts a whole new terms to the concepts of Self driving cars.

Something incredible has taken place in the past 5 years: a revolution in artificial intelligence. After decades of little progress, the combination of big data and advances in computer hardware have brought AI applications to life: from self-driving cars to home assistants to augmented reality and instant language translation. If some of these applications feel like science fiction it's because deep learning algorithms are powering a true breakthrough in machine intelligence. But with these truly impressive advances comes a great deal of hype: fears of terminator-type bots turning on humans and stealing all our jobs. In this video we sort out the fact from fiction in this very exciting field.

From spam filters and self-driving cars, to cutting edge medical diagnosis and real-time language translation, there has been an increasing need for our computers to learn from data and apply that knowledge to make predictions and decisions. This is the heart of machine learning which sits inside the more ambitious goal of artificial intelligence. We may be a long way from self-aware computers that think just like us, but with advancements in deep learning and artificial neural networks our computers are becoming more powerful than ever.

To answer this question, high school student Andrew Zeitler looks at the different parts of our mind that make us human beings. We are given an idea of how certain processes of our brain can be programmed with today's technology. He takes us on a journey from the hard-wired neurones of our brain to the very fundamental aspects of the human species. Within this thought-provoking talk, Andrew shares his idea of how an artificial mind may ""think"" and how such a program would function just like a human being.

Andrew Zeitler is a 17-year-old student in grade 11 at St. Mary CSS. Growing up, Andrew has had many influences from his three siblings and parents. From a young age, he has spent a lot of time working with computers. This experience with computers has allowed Andrew to develop a passion for computer related topics such as electronics and programming as well as partake in the school’s robotics team. Andrew is also interested in music and is a member in the school’s senior and jazz bands. Within these bands, he plays both the tuba and bass guitar. On top of this, Andrew also works part time as a deli clerk within a grocery store. When he finds spare time between school and work, Andrew works on developing different programs and algorithms for learning purposes. After graduation, Andrew hopes to study in the field of computer science at a nearby university. This will be Andrew’s first TED event and he looks forward to having the opportunity to share his ideas.

First-order logic uses quantified variables over non-logical objects and allows the use of sentences that contain variables, so that rather than propositions such as Socrates is a man one can have expressions in the form ""there exists X such that X is Socrates and X is a man"" where there exists is a quantifier and X is a variable.This distinguishes it from propositional logic, which does not use quantifiers.

- The preconditions of the operator become subgoals that must be satisﬁed.We keep doing this unti lwe reach the initial state.
Goal stack planning uses a stack to hold goals and actions to satisfy the goals, and a knowledge base to hold the current state,action schemas and domain axioms
- Goal stack is like a node in a search tree;
if there is a choice of action,we create branches

Goal stack planning pseudocode :

Push the original goal on the stack.Repeat until the stack is empty:
- If stack top is a compound goal, push its unsatisﬁed subgoals 
 on the stack.
- If stack top is a single unsatisﬁed goal,replace it by an action that makes it satisﬁed and push the action’s precondition on the stack.
- If stack top is an action, pop it from the stack, execute it and 
 change the knowledge base by the action’s eﬀects.
- If stack top is a satisﬁed goal, pop it from the stack.","['goal stack planning', 'goal stack planning in hindi', 'goal stack planning in artificial intelligence', 'block world example', 'goal stack planning hindi']",22

About the Course

Edureka's Deep learning with Tensorflow course will help you to learn the basic concepts of TensorFlow, the main functions, operations and the execution pipeline. Starting with a simple “Hello Word” example, throughout the course you will be able to see how TensorFlow can be used in curve fitting, regression, classification and minimization of error functions. This concept is then explored in the Deep Learning world. You will evaluate the common, and not so common, deep neural networks and see how these can be exploited in the real world with complex raw data using TensorFlow. In addition, you will learn how to apply TensorFlow for backpropagation to tune the weights and biases while the Neural Networks are being trained. Finally, the course covers different types of Deep Architectures, such as Convolutional Networks, Recurrent Networks and Autoencoders. 

Delve into neural networks, implement Deep Learning algorithms, and explore layers of data abstraction with the help of this Deep Learning with TensorFlow course.

Why Learn Deep Learning With TensorFlow?

TensorFlow is one of the best libraries to implement Deep Learning. TensorFlow is a software library for numerical computation of mathematical expressions, using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. It was created by Google and tailored for Machine Learning. In fact, it is being widely used to develop solutions with Deep Learning. 

Machine learning is one of the fastest-growing and most exciting fields out there, and Deep Learning represents its true bleeding edge. Deep learning is primarily a study of multi-layered neural networks, spanning over a vast range of model architectures. Traditional neural networks relied on shallow nets, composed of one input, one hidden layer and one output layer. Deep-learning networks are distinguished from these ordinary neural networks having more hidden layers, or so-called more depth. These kinds of nets are capable of discovering hidden structures within unlabeled and unstructured data (i.e. images, sound, and text), which constitutes the vast majority of data in the world.

But how and when will machines be able to explain themselves? Should we be worrying about an artificial intelligence taking over our world or are there bigger and more imminent challenges that advances in machine learning are presenting here and now?

Join Professor Brian Cox, the Royal Society Professor of Public Engagement, as he brings together experts on AI and machine learning to discuss key issues that will shape our future.","['Royal Society', 'science', 'scientists', 'national academy', 'UK', 'brian cox', 'robotics', 'AI', 'machine learning', 'technology', 'debate']",28

George is an author, mentor and speaker.  The presentation is about the Artificial Intelligence (AI) controlling our world and whether it is alien, or human.  

Many of us have considered the idea of a Matrix controlling this planet and at times feel as if we are being steered according to someone’s agenda.  George explores the geopolitical and exopolitical nature of AI and who is behind it.

George has had a lifetime of strange and wonderful experiences.  He has encountered both benevolent and malevolent, inter-dimensional and extra-terrestrial beings.  As a result, George embodies a limitless passion in answering life’s primordial questions, such as, ‘Who are we, where do we come from and what are we doing here?’

The knowledge George shares, along with his values and philosophy have helped thousands of people, to feel, to live in a peaceful, and empowered state.

George knows his life path carries a focus to expose all levels of deception, no matter how far they go, and a deep seeded responsibility to help and liberate humanity from doctrine and dogma, without exception.

As George has said, ‘It’s really a remembering process to revitalise and resurrect the Sovereign and Infinite Being, you truly are.’

53,hmQogtp6-fs,What is Monte Carlo Tree Search? - Artificial Intelligence,UCRPMAqdtSgd0Ipeef7iFsKw,Gaurav Sen,2017-12-25T00:43:46Z,55034,38,"Monte Carlo Tree Search is a search technique in Artificial Intelligence. This has recently been used by Artificial Intelligence Programs like AlphaGo, to play against the world's top Go players. Monte Carlo methods have been used for decades to predict outcomes probabilistically.

Monte Carlo Tree Search is easy to implement in code and is a good alternative to more traditional approaches like Minimax Tree with Alpha-Beta pruning. It uses probabilistic methods to find the seemingly best move, instead of heuristic analysis like Minimax. 

According to Wikipedia: In computer science, Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is a heuristic search algorithm for some kinds of decision processes, most notably those employed in game play.

Programming sites like HackerEarth and Codingame hold Artificial Intelligence contests through games often. These are avenues for us to try the Monte Carlo Tree Search.

Mistake at 12:07 : The exploration bit is the second term. The exploitation bit is the value V_i.

They are complementary technologies, and knowing how both work will make you a much more powerful developer. Artificial Intelligence can use the power of the blockchain to audit data, add incentives to its goals, and even create new types of meritocratic organizations. In this video, i'll talk about how they can both work together, code out the proof of work algorithm in python, then talk about a few other consensus algorithms at a high level.
