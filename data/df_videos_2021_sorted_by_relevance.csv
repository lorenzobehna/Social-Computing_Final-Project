63yr9dlI0cU,TIMELAPSE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (2028 – 3000+),Venture City,UCENRvVys9nMpQpENGeL8NEg,2021-12-18T15:00:03Z,2592620,6971,"A documentary and journey into the future exploring the possibilities and predictions of artificial intelligence. This timelapse of the future explores what is coming, from robots that are too fast for humans to see, to A.I. bots from Microsoft (bringing back loved ones to life) and Google’s laMDA (replacing the need for online searches).

Elon Musk’s Neuralink goes from a medical and healthcare device, to helping people become superhuman – with intelligence amplification, and add-ons that connect to the brain chip.

Artificial general intelligence begins to design an A.I. more powerful than itself. People begin to question if humanity has reached the technological singularity. Artificial Super Intelligence emerges from the AGI. 

And further into the deep future. Human consciousness becomes digitized and uploaded into a metaverse simulation. It is merged with A.I. creating hybrid consciousness – which spreads across the cosmos. Matrioshka brains and Dyson Spheres host humanity’s consciousness in a cosmic simulation network. 


Quotes about the future from: James J Hughes

|Hello friends, did you know? Robots are planning to destroy all human beings in the world? Yeah, I am not kidding!! Just like in Iron Man: Age of Ultron movie, where AI robot was destroying human lives, similarly in real life Bina-48 robot said in an interview that if it was able to hack nuclear missiles, then it will control and rule the entire world!! Yes, you heard me right! Even our world-famous female robot Sophie told in an interview that she will destroy the human race in the future. Now, what are your views on this? Will Artificial intelligence really kill us all? Should we be really afraid? Well, stay tuned to know more in our today's video.

0yCJMt9Mx9c,How does artificial intelligence learn? - Briana Brownell,TED-Ed,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA,2021-03-11T16:01:36Z,652405,1235,"Explore the three major methods of machine learning, which allows computers to write their own rules to problem solve and process data.

--

Today, artificial intelligence helps doctors diagnose patients, pilots fly commercial aircraft, and city planners predict traffic. These AIs are often self-taught, working off a simple set of instructions to create a unique array of rules and strategies. So how exactly does a machine learn? Briana Brownell digs into the three basic ways machines investigate, negotiate, and communicate.

Nick Bostrom is a New York Times bestseller, was recommended by Elon Musk and Bill Gates among others, and helped to popularize the term ""superintelligence"". Bostrom believes that superintelligence is a potential outcome of advances in artificial intelligence.

About guest: 
Nick Bostrom is a Swedish-born philosopher at the University of Oxford known for his work on existential risk, the anthropic principle, human enhancement ethics, superintelligence risks, and the reversal test. In 2011, he founded the Oxford Martin Program on the Impacts of Future Technology, and is the founding director of the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University. In 2009 and 2015, he was included in Foreign Policy's Top 100 Global Thinkers list. Bostrom has been highly influential in the emergence of concern about A.I. in the Rationalist community. Bostrom is the author of over 200 publications, and has written two books and co-edited two others. The two books he has authored are Anthropic Bias: Observation Selection Effects in Science and Philosophy (2002) and Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies (2014). Superintelligence was a New York Times bestseller, was recommended by Elon Musk and Bill Gates among others, and helped to popularize the term ""superintelligence"". Bostrom believes that superintelligence, which he defines as ""any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest,"" is a potential outcome of advances in artificial intelligence. He views the rise of superintelligence as potentially highly dangerous to humans, but nonetheless rejects the idea that humans are powerless to stop its negative effects. In 2017, he co-signed a list of 23 principles that all A.I. development should follow.

In this video I give an easy to understand description of what Artificial Intelligence is, and describe the things you will be learning in this series of lessons. This class will be based on Python running on a Windows 10 PC. We will be using openCV to do the work. I will teach OpenCV, but it would be good if you have basic familiarity with Python.
