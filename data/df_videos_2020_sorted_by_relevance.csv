WXuK6gekU1Y,AlphaGo - The Movie | Full award-winning documentary,Google DeepMind,UCP7jMXSY2xbc3KCAE0MHQ-A,2020-03-13T14:04:51Z,35244527,21381,"With more board configurations than there are atoms in the universe, the ancient Chinese game of Go has long been considered a grand challenge for artificial intelligence. 

On March 9, 2016, the worlds of Go and artificial intelligence collided in South Korea for an extraordinary best-of-five-game competition, coined The DeepMind Challenge Match. Hundreds of millions of people around the world watched as a legendary Go master took on an unproven AI challenger for the first time in history.

Directed by Greg Kohs and with an original score by Academy Award nominee Hauschka, AlphaGo had its premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival. It has since gone on to win countless awards and near universal praise for a story that chronicles a journey from the halls of Oxford, through the backstreets of Bordeaux, past the coding terminals of DeepMind in London, and ultimately, to the seven-day tournament in Seoul. As the drama unfolds, more questions emerge: What can artificial intelligence reveal about a 3000-year-old game? What can it teach us about humanity?

Best documentary winner: Denver International Film Festival (2017), Warsaw International Film Festival (2017), and Traverse City Film Festival (2017).

Official selection at Tribeca Film Festival (2017), BFI London Film Festival (2017), and Critics' Choice Documentary Awards (2017).

-ePZ7OdY-Dw,How artificial intelligence is changing our society | DW Documentary,DW Documentary,UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q,2020-04-18T18:00:01Z,2857765,2224,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing our lives. It touches on all aspects of society - private life, business, security -- including in the spread of fake news and the challenges posed by the advent of autonomous weapons.

This documentary looks at the rapid change digitalization is causing as it unfolds. In particular, breakthroughs in artificial intelligence are opening completely new horizons. In their film about AI, Tilman Wolff and Ranga Yogeshwar examine the role AI plays in the spread of fake news. They also consider a future with robots and the risks and ethical questions posed by the development of autonomous weapons. To address these issues, they travel the globe to speak with leading experts. AI can generate perfectly forged sound and videos, making it effective for purveying fake news. Discerning the truth from fiction will become increasingly difficult. Technology will streamline work, making some jobs surplus to requirements. Software will pilot self-driving cars and aerial drones. AI is rapidly opening up new vistas, but turning blind corners at speed can be risky. How sensible is this type of progress, and at which point should society step in and set limits to its development?

Answering this question is no easy task. No one can know for certain, what will occur and what will be created. Modern technologies and latest developments show us that making music will become increasingly computer-based and AI-driven, and lastly, it may serve as a window to the past, held open by any musicians continuing to create music in more traditional ways.
AI, or artificial intelligence, has been part of popular discussion since the 1980s, but only recently has it started to look like an actual possibility.  Deep learning is a part of machine learning where AI mimics how humans think. It creates patterns based on data and information it receives from the internet. AI uses resources like social media and search engines such as Google and Youtube to learn music history and different songs. AI then uses the information it learns to distinguish patterns, tempos, and notes to create its own melodies.
But we hope Artificial Intelligent composers will not take over an artists' job. However, it will shape the world with the expansion of creating new music and evolving life.
Even if the Future Garage has nothing to do with the future itself, we are still free to imagine the sounds and beats that A.I. may use as a pattern for producing its own tracks. 
GENRE: FUTURE GARAGE (also known as Nu-Garage, Post-Garage, Space Garage, Minimal Garage, Atmospheric Garage) is a genre of electronic music that incorporates a variety of influences from UK garage and softer elements from 2-step garage, leading to an off-kilter rhythmic style. Characteristic sounds are pitched vocal chops, warm filtered reese basses, dark atmospheres (including synth pads, field recordings and other atmospheric sounds) and vinyl crackles. The tempo usually ranges from 130 to 140 bpm, but can also be slower or faster.

bvf_n6Cnp8s,2084: Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Humanity | John C. Lennox,zondervan,UCKUDMeYSjLvcsSw2JR-fmvg,2020-08-31T17:09:10Z,304483,753,"Where did we come from? Where we are going? The answers to these questions inform both our understanding of who we are and what we live for.

Through the ages, people have turned to science, philosophy, religion, and politics to satisfy their curiosity and their cravings for answers. Now, in the twenty-first century, the question of where we are going has become tied to technological advancements and is given a new urgency by the development of artificial intelligence.

But what does the often unsolicited and unrestricted incorporation of AI in our lives mean for us? For our individual and corporate privacy? Our political and personal freedom? The security of our jobs? Indeed for the future of our species as a whole?

What implications do advances in AI have on our worldviews in general and the God question in particular?

In the new 2084 series, scientist and philosopher John C. Lennox addresses the questions of where humanity is going. It‚Äôs a thought-provoking, balanced, and engaging resource on technology, meaning, and what it means to be a human being created in the image of God.

The 2084 series shows you how the Christian worldview, when properly understood, can provide evidence-based, credible answers that will bring real hope for the future of humanity.
