Typo correction: At 14 minutes 45 seconds, the last index on the bias vector is n, when it's supposed to in fact be a k.  Thanks for the sharp eyes that caught that!

For those who want to learn more, I highly recommend the book by Michael Nielsen introducing neural networks and deep learning: https://goo.gl/Zmczdy

There are two neat things about this book.  First, it's available for free, so consider joining me in making a donation Nielsen's way if you get something out of it.  And second, it's centered around walking through some code and data which you can download yourself, and which covers the same example that I introduce in this video.  Yay for active learning!

I also highly recommend Chris Olah's blog: http://colah.github.io/

For more videos, Welch Labs also has some great series on machine learning:

SUBSCRIBE OUR CHANNEL

It’s hard to believe how far we’ve come. We launched just a few years ago with our surveillance drones, and in this short amount of time, we’ve retooled cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, such as deep learning and convolution neural networks, into hardware systems that governments and peace-keeping agencies can use to keep their troops safe. No more sending our brave patriots home in coffins. Now the artificial intelligence does all of the work. Our autonomous weapons are small, fast, accurate, and unstoppable.
And they are just the beginning. Smart swarms. Adaptive adversarial learning. On-the-field robust target prioritization. AI-powered tactics and strategy a Go master would envy. This is the future of peacekeeping.

About the technology
Our Autonomous anti-Personnel Systems (APS) employ an array of cutting edge AI technology, including:

Obstacle avoidance: the neural network copied into every APS has been trained through the equivalent of millions of hours in varied simulated environments to avoid obstacles, even when they are in motion.
Stochastic movements: trained on thousands of movies of mosquitoes and other flying insects, our drones will defeat any attempt to anticipate their flight patterns.
Efficient munitions: using precise targeting, we are able to drive the size of a projectile and propellant to a bare minimum.
Facial recognition: it’s in your iPhone and it’s in APS, along with parallel networks to identify targets by gait, gender, uniform, even ethnicity.
Multiple self-location protocols: along with GPS, our APSs use a variety of proprietary technologies to locate themselves in space.
Incommunicado and EMP hardened: once an APS gets flying, there is no way to stop it electromagnetically by jamming, spoofing, zapping, or anything else.
Big data links: we’ve acquired and consolidated a host of data sets. Using our servers you can reliably tie individuals to their individual characteristics for later targeting. We’d tell you more, but as the joke goes, then we’d have to kill you. (And of course, since you’ve visited this site we know exactly who you are.) Again, just kidding!

The Stinger anti-Personnel System
The Stinger is our first mass-produced mini-weapon. It's fully autonomous with wide-field cameras, tactical sensors, facial recognition, processors that can react 100 times faster than a human, and its stochastic motion is an anti-sniper feature. Inside it are three grams of shaped explosives that offer just enough power to penetrate the skull and kill the target with surgical precision.

All About Teamwork
Vanguard Delivery and Breaching System
Each delivery system can carry 18 Stingers. The delivery system arrives at a building or some other enclosed space (car, train, plane, you name it), releases its cargo, attaches to the barrier, and blows a hole in the wall or window. The Stingers can then enter the building and find their targets. These systems are virtually unstoppable. Target terrorist cells, infiltrate enemy compounds -- the bad guys will not be able to defend against them.

Identify and Target Only the Bad Guys
The EyeFire Target Identification System
All of our systems can use facial recognition to identify a predetermined target, but what about threatening underground movements or secret terrorists cells? It's not like there are public hashtags that terrorists use to identify themselves. The EyeFire Target Identification System isn't just the little bot, but an entire big-data processing system that can scan billions of tweets, posts, pages, videos, and anything else you can find online to identify patterns indicative of terrorist activity. The system then crawls that data to identify IP addresses and GPS locations to identify the suspect posting the dangerous messages. It can also track down who the suspect is collaborating with. We'll help you weed out the bad guys.
SoftTouch Bot
A new form of regime change. The world is full of deadly leaders who are harming their citizens and threatening global security. Until recently, it's been hard to oust these bad actors: they're hard to get to and even if someone can get close enough for the kill, an obvious murder can lead to greater unrest. But these little bots are about the size of a bee, they can fly anywhere, get inside any building, hide inside any vent, and strike while the target sleeps. The question literally becomes: what's your poison? The bots can be filled with a lethal dose of the poison of your choice, and the mark left on the body will be barely noticeable, looking like nothing more than a bug bite.","['KILLER DRONE', 'INTELLIGENCE', 'DEFENCE', 'PRIVACY', 'SECURITY', 'Drone', 'Arm Industries', 'Intelligent Weapons', 'Spying', 'Terrorism', 'Drone Killer', 'Prepper', 'Survival', 'Technology', 'Privacy', 'Tesla', 'Ferrari', 'Lamborghini', 'MSC']",22,

One of my favorite reads:
""Sapiens"" by Yuval Noah Harari - https://amzn.to/2MnrO2V

Robots are more advanced than many of us may think. They are fully capable of having real world conversations, and have the mental and cognitive structures to eventually surpass humanity in 3-5 years according to Hanson Robotic chief scientist Ben Goertzel. 

Elon Musk with his Artificial Intelligence company OpenAI, which studies the potential dangers associated with A.I. has been adamantly warning humanity that Artificial Intelligence poses one of the biggest impending dangers humanity must confront in the coming years.

The Russians are also in the A.I. game, and have essentially built a Terminator like war robot termed Fedor. They have a robot that doesn't just accurately shoots targets, but also drives a car, which puts a whole new terms to the concepts of Self driving cars.

Something incredible has taken place in the past 5 years: a revolution in artificial intelligence. After decades of little progress, the combination of big data and advances in computer hardware have brought AI applications to life: from self-driving cars to home assistants to augmented reality and instant language translation. If some of these applications feel like science fiction it's because deep learning algorithms are powering a true breakthrough in machine intelligence. But with these truly impressive advances comes a great deal of hype: fears of terminator-type bots turning on humans and stealing all our jobs. In this video we sort out the fact from fiction in this very exciting field.

clfFT1XOJKM,The Truth Behind Artificial Intelligence | Andrew Zeitler | TEDxStMaryCSSchool,TEDx Talks,UCsT0YIqwnpJCM-mx7-gSA4Q,2017-06-08T16:34:56Z,579430,575,"What is a true artificial intelligence and why don't we have it today? To answer this question, high school student Andrew Zeitler looks at the different parts of our mind that make us human beings. We are given an idea of how certain processes of our brain can be programmed with today's technology. He takes us on a journey from the hard-wired neurones of our brain to the very fundamental aspects of the human species. Within this thought-provoking talk, Andrew shares his idea of how an artificial mind may ""think"" and how such a program would function just like a human being.

Andrew Zeitler is a 17-year-old student in grade 11 at St. Mary CSS. Growing up, Andrew has had many influences from his three siblings and parents. From a young age, he has spent a lot of time working with computers. This experience with computers has allowed Andrew to develop a passion for computer related topics such as electronics and programming as well as partake in the school’s robotics team. Andrew is also interested in music and is a member in the school’s senior and jazz bands. Within these bands, he plays both the tuba and bass guitar. On top of this, Andrew also works part time as a deli clerk within a grocery store. When he finds spare time between school and work, Andrew works on developing different programs and algorithms for learning purposes. After graduation, Andrew hopes to study in the field of computer science at a nearby university. This will be Andrew’s first TED event and he looks forward to having the opportunity to share his ideas.
