s0dMTAQM4cw,Artificial intelligence and algorithms: pros and cons | DW Documentary (AI documentary),DW Documentary,UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q,2019-09-26T18:00:05Z,10612549,9603,"Developments in artificial intelligence (AI) are leading to fundamental changes in the way we live. Algorithms can already detect Parkinson's disease and cancer, and control both cars and aircraft. How will AI change our society in the future?

This documentary journeys to the hot spots of AI research in Europe, the USA and China, and looks at the revolutionary developments which are currently taking place. The rapid growth of AI offers many opportunities, but also many dangers. AI can be used to create sound and video recordings which will make it more and more difficult to distinguish between fact and fiction. It will make the world of work more efficient and many professions superfluous. Algorithms can decide whether to grant loans, who is an insurance risk, and how good employees are. But there is a huge problem: humans can no longer comprehend how algorithms arrive at their decisions. And another big problem is AI’s capacity for widespread surveillance. The Chinese city of Rongcheng is already using an AI-supported 'social credit system' to monitor and assess its citizens. Does AI pose a danger to our personal freedoms or democracy? Which decisions can we leave to the algorithms - and which do we want to? And what are AI’s social implications?

We need to establish ethical standards in dealing with artificial intelligence - and to answer the question: What still makes us as human beings unique?

Mankind is still decades away from self-learning machines that are as intelligent as humans. But already today, chatbots, robots, digital assistants and other artificially intelligent entities exist that can emulate certain human abilities. Scientists and AI experts agree that we are in a race against time: we need to establish ethical guidelines before technology catches up with us.  While AI Professor Jürgen Schmidhuber predicts artificial intelligence will be able to control robotic factories in space, the Swedish-American physicist Max Tegmark warns against a totalitarian AI surveillance state, and the philosopher Thomas Metzinger predicts a deadly AI arms race. But Metzinger also believes that Europe in particular can play a pioneering role on the threshold of this new era: creating a binding international code of ethics.

This video on What is a Neural Networkdelivers an entertaining and exciting introduction to the concepts of Neural Network. We will learn the different layers present in a Neural Network and understand how these layers process data. We will get an idea of the different parameters used in a Neural Network such as weights, bias, and activation functions. We will also understand how to train a Neural Network using forward propagation and then adjust to the errors in the network using the backpropagation method. This video also covers a few popular Neural Network applications. Now, let us jump straight into learning what is a Neural Network.
