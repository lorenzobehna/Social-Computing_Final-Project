Does the AI (from https://www.fotor.com/features/ai-image-generator/) demonstrate an understanding of the theological themes of the passage?

I'm getting ahead of myself here. Artificial intelligence art generation is a controversial topic and it should be. I've been toying with it for the last several days and I'm both intrigued and disturbed by what I'm seeing. That said, I set out to generate art depicting the story of Jesus calming the storm in Matthew 8, and that's just what I did. For better or worse, here's the process I went through (in almost real time, though I did trim about a minute of dead space while waiting on the AI to render), and the final product.

They discuss the shortcomings of science in the search for universal truth, the factors behind rising secularism in the West, China‚Äôs rapid AI implementation, our growing desire for immortality through biomedicine and the true meaning of 'faith‚Äô. 

John Lennox is Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford, author, Christian apologist, bioethicist and philosopher. He has written many highly-regarded books on religion, ethics and the relationship between science and faith.

In 2020, Lennox published 2084 - Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Humanity, which covers key developments in technological enhancement, bioengineering and AI. In the book, he discusses the current state of AI - its benefits, dangers and future implications.

Over the past 15 years, Lennox has been part of numerous public debates defending the Christian faith, including debates with Christopher Hitchens, Michael Shermer and Richard Dawkins.

The rate of improvement of AI excites and worries us. Should we be developing a technology that may ultimately make us extinct? With the AI only focusing on its original purpose and finding new ways to effectively achieve it. The question is how dangerous it could be to humanity. While we cannot deny the merits of AI, Our great scientists have progressed rapidly, from inventing Apple's SIRI to Tesla's Self-driven cars. Artificial Intelligence has come a long way. Artificial Intelligence is termed as Narrow AI today, with its limited abilities. However, our scientists have a great vision. They are yet to come up with General AI. Narrow AI, with its limitations, might still outperform humans at any task; however, with General AI, it is sure to beat humans at any cognitive task. #ElonMusk concerns are much larger than hack threats. He isn't vacillating on his concerns about #AI #interview he thinks it's dangerous and requires regulation.
