This timelapse of the future explores what is coming, from robots that are too fast for humans to see, to A.I. bots from Microsoft (bringing back loved ones to life) and Google’s laMDA (replacing the need for online searches).

Elon Musk’s Neuralink goes from a medical and healthcare device, to helping people become superhuman – with intelligence amplification, and add-ons that connect to the brain chip.

Artificial general intelligence begins to design an A.I. more powerful than itself. People begin to question if humanity has reached the technological singularity. Artificial Super Intelligence emerges from the AGI. 

And further into the deep future. Human consciousness becomes digitized and uploaded into a metaverse simulation. It is merged with A.I. creating hybrid consciousness – which spreads across the cosmos. Matrioshka brains and Dyson Spheres host humanity’s consciousness in a cosmic simulation network.

--

Today, artificial intelligence helps doctors diagnose patients, pilots fly commercial aircraft, and city planners predict traffic. These AIs are often self-taught, working off a simple set of instructions to create a unique array of rules and strategies. So how exactly does a machine learn? Briana Brownell digs into the three basic ways machines investigate, negotiate, and communicate.

5B3Wn6Wo5CU,The Dangers of Artificial Intelligence - Stuart Russell on AI Risk,Science Time,UCxoz4YfS4M3H3C57FD4jW4Q,2021-09-25T21:00:00Z,191524,584,"Stuart Russell is a British computer scientist known for his contributions to artificial intelligence. He warns about the risks involved in the creation of AI systems.

Artificial intelligence has become a key behind-the-scenes component of many aspects of our day-to-day lives.

The promise of AI has lured many into attempting to harness it for societal benefit, but there are also concerns about its potential misuse.

Dr. Stuart Russell is one of AI’s true pioneers and has been at the forefront of the field for decades. He proposes a novel solution which bring us to a better understanding of what it will take to create beneficial machine intelligence.

In view of the recent warnings from researchers and entrepreneurs that artificial intelligence or AI may become too smart, major players in the technology field are thinking about different methods for mitigating these concerns and preserving human control.

Stuart Russell, argues that if AI surpasses humanity in general intelligence and becomes Superintelligent, then this new Superintelligence could become powerful and difficult to control. 

Existing weak AI systems can be monitored and easily shut down and modified if they misbehave. However, a misprogrammed Superintelligence, which by definition is smarter than humans in solving practical problems it encounters in the course of pursuing its goals, would realize that allowing itself to be shut down and modified might interfere with its ability to accomplish its current goals. If the Superintelligence therefore decides to resist shutdown and modification, it would be smart enough to outwit its human operators and other efforts to shut it down.

Nick Bostrom is a New York Times bestseller, was recommended by Elon Musk and Bill Gates among others, and helped to popularize the term ""superintelligence"". Bostrom believes that superintelligence is a potential outcome of advances in artificial intelligence.

About guest: 
Nick Bostrom is a Swedish-born philosopher at the University of Oxford known for his work on existential risk, the anthropic principle, human enhancement ethics, superintelligence risks, and the reversal test. In 2011, he founded the Oxford Martin Program on the Impacts of Future Technology, and is the founding director of the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University. In 2009 and 2015, he was included in Foreign Policy's Top 100 Global Thinkers list. Bostrom has been highly influential in the emergence of concern about A.I. in the Rationalist community. Bostrom is the author of over 200 publications, and has written two books and co-edited two others. The two books he has authored are Anthropic Bias: Observation Selection Effects in Science and Philosophy (2002) and Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies (2014). Superintelligence was a New York Times bestseller, was recommended by Elon Musk and Bill Gates among others, and helped to popularize the term ""superintelligence"". Bostrom believes that superintelligence, which he defines as ""any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest,"" is a potential outcome of advances in artificial intelligence. He views the rise of superintelligence as potentially highly dangerous to humans, but nonetheless rejects the idea that humans are powerless to stop its negative effects. In 2017, he co-signed a list of 23 principles that all A.I. development should follow.
