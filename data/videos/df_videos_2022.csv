0fDJXmqdN-A,I asked AI to make a Music Video... the results are trippy,DoodleChaos,UCnVimh35ecf46P_Bt-2AArg,2022-05-17T14:06:55Z,4151975,12152,"In this video, I utilized artificial intelligence to generate an animated music video for the song Canvas by Resonate.  This tool allows anyone to generate beautiful images using only text as the input. My question was, what if I used song lyrics as input to the AI, can I make perfect music synchronized videos automatically with the push of a button? Let me know how you think the AI did in this visual interpretation of the song. 

After getting caught up in the excitement around DALL·E2 (latest and greatest AI system, it's INSANE), I searched for any way I could use similar image generation for music synchronization. Since DALL·E2 is not available to the public yet, my search led me to VQGAN + CLIP (Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network and Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training), before settling more specifically on Disco Diffusion V5.2 Turbo. If you don't know what any of these words or acronyms mean, don't worry, I was just as confused when I first started learning about this technology. I believe we're reaching a turning point where entire industries are about to shift in reaction to this new process (which is essentially magic!). 

Important note: 
While this AI is impressive, it still required additional input beyond just the song lyrics to achieve the music video I was looking for. For example, I added keyframes for camera motion throughout the generated world. These keyframes were manually synchronized to the beat by me. I also specified changes to the art style at different moments of the song. Since many of the lyrics are quite non-specific, even a human illustrator would have a hard time making visual representations. To make the lyrics more digestible by the AI, I sometimes modified the phrase to be more coherent, such as specifying a setting or atmosphere. 

This was my first time working with DDV5, and I'm very happy with the results! There were many times where my jaw dropped upon seeing what the AI came up with. I haven't felt this sense of wonder from technology since I first experienced a HD videogame as a child.

I'm getting ahead of myself here. Artificial intelligence art generation is a controversial topic and it should be. I've been toying with it for the last several days and I'm both intrigued and disturbed by what I'm seeing. That said, I set out to generate art depicting the story of Jesus calming the storm in Matthew 8, and that's just what I did. For better or worse, here's the process I went through (in almost real time, though I did trim about a minute of dead space while waiting on the AI to render), and the final product.

Beginning in January 2021, advances in AI research have produced a plethora of deep-learning models capable of generating original images from simple text prompts, effectively extending the human imagination. Researchers at OpenAI, Google, Facebook, and others have developed text-to-image tools that they have not yet released to the public, and similar models have proliferated online in the open-source arena and at smaller companies like Midjourney.

These tools represent a massive cultural shift because they remove the requirement for technical labor from the process of image-making. Instead, they select for creative ideation, skillful use of language, and curatorial taste. The ultimate consequences are difficult to predict, but — like the invention of the camera, and the digital camera thereafter — these algorithms herald a new, democratized form of expression that will commence another explosion in the volume of imagery produced by humans. But, like other automated systems trained on historical data and internet images, they also come with risks that have not been resolved. 

The video above is a primer on how we got here, how this technology works, and some of the implications. And for an extended discussion about what this means for human artists, designers, and illustrators, check out this bonus video: https://youtu.be/sFBfrZ-N3G4

In the coming years, artificial intelligence is probably going to change your life— and likely the entire world. But people have a hard time agreeing on exactly how AI will affect our society. Can we build AI systems that help us fix the world? Or are we doomed to a robotic takeover? Explore the limitations of artificial intelligence and the possibility of creating human-compatible technology.

They discuss the shortcomings of science in the search for universal truth, the factors behind rising secularism in the West, China’s rapid AI implementation, our growing desire for immortality through biomedicine and the true meaning of 'faith’. 

John Lennox is Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford, author, Christian apologist, bioethicist and philosopher. He has written many highly-regarded books on religion, ethics and the relationship between science and faith.

In 2020, Lennox published 2084 - Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Humanity, which covers key developments in technological enhancement, bioengineering and AI. In the book, he discusses the current state of AI - its benefits, dangers and future implications.

Over the past 15 years, Lennox has been part of numerous public debates defending the Christian faith, including debates with Christopher Hitchens, Michael Shermer and Richard Dawkins.
