WXuK6gekU1Y,AlphaGo - The Movie | Full award-winning documentary,Google DeepMind,UCP7jMXSY2xbc3KCAE0MHQ-A,2020-03-13T14:04:51Z,35241545,21378,"With more board configurations than there are atoms in the universe, the ancient Chinese game of Go has long been considered a grand challenge for artificial intelligence. 

On March 9, 2016, the worlds of Go and artificial intelligence collided in South Korea for an extraordinary best-of-five-game competition, coined The DeepMind Challenge Match. Hundreds of millions of people around the world watched as a legendary Go master took on an unproven AI challenger for the first time in history.

Directed by Greg Kohs and with an original score by Academy Award nominee Hauschka, AlphaGo had its premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival. It has since gone on to win countless awards and near universal praise for a story that chronicles a journey from the halls of Oxford, through the backstreets of Bordeaux, past the coding terminals of DeepMind in London, and ultimately, to the seven-day tournament in Seoul. As the drama unfolds, more questions emerge: What can artificial intelligence reveal about a 3000-year-old game? What can it teach us about humanity?

Best documentary winner: Denver International Film Festival (2017), Warsaw International Film Festival (2017), and Traverse City Film Festival (2017).

Official selection at Tribeca Film Festival (2017), BFI London Film Festival (2017), and Critics' Choice Documentary Awards (2017).

Pepper can also gather comprehensive data to enrich the customer base and generate shopper insights. 

Atlas
Atlas is the world’s most dynamic humanoid robot built by BostonDynamics, a company that was previously owned by Google and now by SoftBank. Atlas is becoming more sophisticated year by year, thanks to its state of the art hardware and algorithm that allows it to quickly understand instructions. With its 28 hydraulic joints, 4.9 feet of height and 176 pounds weight, the robot can perform both impressive terrifying acts including navigating uneven terrain, jumping around a parkour course, doing somersaults. All these activities demonstrate human-level agility so the robot can be perfect for search and rescue operations and performing human tasks in environments where humans could not survive.

Spot
Spot is a robot dog designed for industrial uses such as carrying goods through a warehouse and inspecting a remote site with an unfavorable environment for human operators. It can run at 5.2 feet per second, has 360-degree cameras, and can operate in temperatures ranging from 4 to 113 Fahrenheit. With its API and flexible payload interface, the robot can be easily customized for desired tasks. Spot is also manufactured by BostonDynamics and is now being leased to eligible companies. 

HRP-5P
HRP-5P is an advanced humanoid robot designed to operate autonomously and carry out heavy labor in hazardous environments. It is equipped with environmental sensors and object recognition, full-body motion planning and control, and task description and execution management. HRP-5P is based on more than 20 years of humanoid research at AIST. In those 20 years, the institute has created 4 other robots which are the predecessor of HRP-5P. 


Surena IV
Surena IV is the fourth generation of Surena humanoid robot series developed by the University of Tehran in Iran. With a height of 5.6 feet and a weight of 154 pounds, this robot is able to walk at a speed of 0.43 miles per hour. Its custom force sensors at the bottom of its feet help the robot step over uneven surfaces by adjusting the angle and position of each foot. 

Aquanaut

Meet Harmony, the robot from California-based Realbotix, has been in development since 2016. It can tell jokes, talk dirty , and make realistic noises and facial expressions.
The Harmony robot works by connecting via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to an artificial intelligence Android application called Harmony AI.

Meet Nadine. Nadine was developed using cutting edge robotics technology to simulate human behavior. She has 3D depths cameras, a microphone, and a webcam to gather visual and audio inputs. Then there are various perception layers that process these inputs to recognize different faces, gestures, emotions, behavior, etc. and then respond accordingly. Nadine also had inbuilt chat-bots that allow her to handle different queries and a memory model that remembers different users and conversations with them. In addition to all this, Nadine can also converse in 6 languages, namely English, German, French, Chinese, Hindi, and Japanese. So you won’t have any problems talking to her!

Meet Sophia. Sophia, a humanoid robot developed by Hong Kong based company Hanson Robotics, was the first robot ever to be given citizenship of any country. Sofia is now officially a Saudi Arab citizen!!! And she is an extremely popular robot! She was developed to look like Audrey Hepburn, a famous Hollywood actress and has appeared in various interviews with the United Nations, Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallen in America, British Broadcasting Company. Mr. Hanson, the creator of Sophia believes that she will be a perfect fit as an old age companion in nursing homes, a crowd manager in large events or parks . In short, he hopes Sophia can ultimately gain enough social skills to interact convincingly with human beings.

Meet Erica. When you watch the news, you get to know the latest updates from the news anchor. But now, that news anchor might be a robot! If you are in Japan, you might be getting your daily news from Erica, a Japanese robot. 
Erica was created by Hiroshi Ishiguro, the director of the Intelligent Robotics Laboratory at Osaka University. She is one of the most intelligent humanoids developed in Japan with a special emphasis on her speech capabilities. And while Erica cannot walk, she can easily interact with human beings and change her facial expressions according to the conversation.

Jia- Jia. Guess who is called the Robot Goddess of China ! Its Jia Jia, a humanoid robot developed by a team from the University of Science and Technology of China. 
Jia Jia is considered the most beautiful woman in China, and this effect is only increased by the fact that, she can talk to people and reply accordingly. 
While her speech patterns are still not smooth enough, Jia Jia makes up for it, by looking remarkably human-like, because of her eye movements and speech-lip synchronization.

It touches on all aspects of society - private life, business, security -- including in the spread of fake news and the challenges posed by the advent of autonomous weapons.

This documentary looks at the rapid change digitalization is causing as it unfolds. In particular, breakthroughs in artificial intelligence are opening completely new horizons. In their film about AI, Tilman Wolff and Ranga Yogeshwar examine the role AI plays in the spread of fake news. They also consider a future with robots and the risks and ethical questions posed by the development of autonomous weapons. To address these issues, they travel the globe to speak with leading experts. AI can generate perfectly forged sound and videos, making it effective for purveying fake news. Discerning the truth from fiction will become increasingly difficult. Technology will streamline work, making some jobs surplus to requirements. Software will pilot self-driving cars and aerial drones. AI is rapidly opening up new vistas, but turning blind corners at speed can be risky. How sensible is this type of progress, and at which point should society step in and set limits to its development?

Answering this question is no easy task. No one can know for certain, what will occur and what will be created. Modern technologies and latest developments show us that making music will become increasingly computer-based and AI-driven, and lastly, it may serve as a window to the past, held open by any musicians continuing to create music in more traditional ways.
AI, or artificial intelligence, has been part of popular discussion since the 1980s, but only recently has it started to look like an actual possibility.  Deep learning is a part of machine learning where AI mimics how humans think. It creates patterns based on data and information it receives from the internet. AI uses resources like social media and search engines such as Google and Youtube to learn music history and different songs. AI then uses the information it learns to distinguish patterns, tempos, and notes to create its own melodies.
But we hope Artificial Intelligent composers will not take over an artists' job. However, it will shape the world with the expansion of creating new music and evolving life.
Even if the Future Garage has nothing to do with the future itself, we are still free to imagine the sounds and beats that A.I. may use as a pattern for producing its own tracks. 
GENRE: FUTURE GARAGE (also known as Nu-Garage, Post-Garage, Space Garage, Minimal Garage, Atmospheric Garage) is a genre of electronic music that incorporates a variety of influences from UK garage and softer elements from 2-step garage, leading to an off-kilter rhythmic style. Characteristic sounds are pitched vocal chops, warm filtered reese basses, dark atmospheres (including synth pads, field recordings and other atmospheric sounds) and vinyl crackles. The tempo usually ranges from 130 to 140 bpm, but can also be slower or faster.

Kktn6BPg1sI,From Artificial Intelligence to Superintelligence: Nick Bostrom on AI & The Future of Humanity,Science Time,UCxoz4YfS4M3H3C57FD4jW4Q,2020-11-21T20:00:02Z,374354,1077,"Artificial Superintelligence or ASI, sometimes referred to as digital superintelligence is the advent of a hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far surpassing that of the smartest and most gifted human minds. AI is a rapidly growing field of technology with the potential to make huge improvements in human wellbeing. However, the development of machines with intelligence vastly superior to humans will pose special, perhaps even unique risks.

Most surveyed AI researchers expect machines to eventually be able to rival humans in intelligence, though there is little consensus on when or how this will happen.

One only needs to accept three basic assumptions to recognize the inevitability of superintelligent AI:
- Intelligence is a product of information processing in physical systems.
- We will continue to improve our intelligent machines.
- We do not stand on the peak of intelligence or anywhere near it.

Philosopher Nick Bostrom expressed concern about what values a superintelligence should be designed to have.
Any type of AI superintelligence could proceed rapidly to its programmed goals, with little or no distribution of power to others. It may not take its designers into account at all. The logic of its goals may not be reconcilable with human ideals. The AI’s power might lie in making humans its servants rather than vice versa. If it were to succeed in this, it would “rule without competition under a dictatorship of one”.

Elon Musk has also warned that the global race toward AI could result in a third world war.
To avoid the ‘worst mistake in history’, it is necessary to understand the nature of an AI race, as well as escape the development that could lead to unfriendly Artificial Superintelligence. 

To ensure the friendly nature of artificial superintelligence, world leaders should work to ensure that this ASI is beneficial to the entire human race.

bvf_n6Cnp8s,2084: Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Humanity | John C. Lennox,zondervan,UCKUDMeYSjLvcsSw2JR-fmvg,2020-08-31T17:09:10Z,304453,753,"Where did we come from? Where we are going? The answers to these questions inform both our understanding of who we are and what we live for.

Through the ages, people have turned to science, philosophy, religion, and politics to satisfy their curiosity and their cravings for answers. Now, in the twenty-first century, the question of where we are going has become tied to technological advancements and is given a new urgency by the development of artificial intelligence.

But what does the often unsolicited and unrestricted incorporation of AI in our lives mean for us? For our individual and corporate privacy? Our political and personal freedom? The security of our jobs? Indeed for the future of our species as a whole?

What implications do advances in AI have on our worldviews in general and the God question in particular?

In the new 2084 series, scientist and philosopher John C. Lennox addresses the questions of where humanity is going. It’s a thought-provoking, balanced, and engaging resource on technology, meaning, and what it means to be a human being created in the image of God.

The 2084 series shows you how the Christian worldview, when properly understood, can provide evidence-based, credible answers that will bring real hope for the future of humanity.
